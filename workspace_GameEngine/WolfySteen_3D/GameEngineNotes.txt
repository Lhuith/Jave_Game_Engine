||RENDERING ENGINE||
||UI  ENGINE||
||PHYSICS ENGINE||

-Some way to insert game into engine
-Better Scratchpad support
-Better textires[reading, blitting, basic image processing]
-Some way to seperate game and engine data

-Add Higher level rendering construct(Shaders, Materials, Meshes, Transform)
-Add some form of auto shader select
-Add some form of primitives(Squares, Recangles, Spheres)
-More flexible Transform class (defualt values for projection and camera)
-Non perspective Views, Orthogonal views
-Texture Minipulation (Translation, Rotation, Scale)
-More Control over Textures (Filtering, Formating)
-More Freindly Constructors
-Window should have more properties(Centre pos, Fullscreen, maybe mouse locking)
-better vector math (normilization, +=, Common used Vector Constants, swizzling support)
-Options class/system some place to read values that the player chooses
-Centralized "level or Scene " class that holds the data the game is using
-Game object class
-Make all positioning names "position"
-Make naming more consistant
-Vector Swizzling

-Eventually make easier way of generating way
-Eventually make easy way to generate texCoords
